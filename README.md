## üöÄ My Journey

<details>
<summary>Click to explore my development journey</summary>
<br>

My journey in tech began in my earliest years of childhood. Initially, I experimented with different software, tried new things and was genuinely curious to see the outcome of doing something new while also breaking stuff in the process and learning from it. By age 10, I had already been experimenting with virtual machines, Linux, and more advanced tools, and two years later, I started formally programming and setting up a home server on an older laptop. I went from building small projects to now, 7 years later, having built RekoSearch - an almost 50k LoC SaaS app made with Rust, Python and web technologies on AWS and Kubernetes - and my Home Lab with 47+ user-accessible services securely exposed to the internet.
